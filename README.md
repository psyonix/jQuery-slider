# jQuery-slider
This is not original work. This was an assignment for The Odin Project. The only notable changes from the tutorial are the order in which I've declared the functions, and the conventions used in the script. Eveything else was coded verbatim to the tutorial. All credit goes to Helping Develop. The full turorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtYP_eSVKfs
